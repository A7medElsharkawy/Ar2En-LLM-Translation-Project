# Ar2En-LLM-Translation-Project


This project is a fine-tuned translation model designed to translate Arabic  to English lang. The model is based on a pre-trained model from Hugging Face and has been fine-tuned on the KDE4 dataset, which contains 116,239 translation sentence pairs.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the key files and directories:

- **translation_model/**: This directory contains the fine-tuned model.
- **app.py**: A Streamlit application to interact with the model through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Dockerfile**: Defines the environment for deploying the model as a Docker container.
- **model_test.mp4**: A video demonstrating the model in action.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the dependencies required to run the model and the Streamlit app.
- **fine-tuning-model.ipynb**: this is the fine-tuned notebook.

## Dataset

The model was fine-tuned on the [KDE4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kde4) dataset, which includes 116,239 sentence pairs translating from Modern Standard Arabic to Egyptian Arabic.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and Docker installed.

## Installation Steps

### *Using Docker* üêã
Running the application with Docker is simple and ensures an isolated environment. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/A7medElsharkawy/Ar2En-LLM-Translation-Project

   cd Ar2En-LLM-Translation-Project


2. build and run docker file:

   ```bash
   docker build -it any-name .

   docker run -p 8501:8501 any-name
   ```
   go to  [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
   
### *Running Locally* üíª
Ensure you clone the Repo Locally
<br>
<br>

1. Create `Virtual Environment`:
<br>
   It is recommended to create and use a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts:
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```

3. run app Script: 
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

Open a web browser and go to:
 [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
